  server. Same Ruby code runs on the client and server! (Isomorphic App Development) Volt plans to integrate RethinkDB and RubyMotion.   

## Middlewares

> Where you can find middlewares

* [Rack built-in middlewares](https://github.com/rack/rack):

    * `Rack::Builder` - Implements a small DSL to iteratively construct Rack applications.
    * `Rack::BodyProxy` - 
    * `Rack::Cascade` - Tries a request on several apps, and returns the first response that is not 404 or 405 (or in a list of 
      configurable status codes).
    * `Rack::Chunked` - Middleware that applies chunked transfer encoding to response bodies when the response does not include 
      a Content-Length header.          
    * `Rack::CommonLogger` - For creating Apache-style logfiles.
    * `Rack::ConditionalGet` - Middleware that enables conditional GET using If-None-Match and If-Modified-Since. 
      The application should set either or both of the Last-Modified or Etag response headers according to RFC 2616
    * `Rack::Config` - modifies the environment using the block given during initialization
    * `Rack::ContentLength` - Sets the Content-Length header on responses with fixed-length bodies
    * `Rack::ContentType` - Sets the Content-Type header on responses which don't have one
    * `Rack::ETag` - Adds ETag header on all String bodies. ETags are used to validate cache.
    * `Rack::File` - serves files below the root directory given, according to the path info of the Rack request. 
      e.g. when Rack::File.new("/etc") is used, you can access 'passwd' file as http://localhost:9292/passwd
    * `Rack::Deflater` - enables compression of http responses, currently supported compression algorithms: gzip, deflate, 
      identy (no transformation)
    * `Rack::Directory` - serves entries below the root given, according to the path info of the Rack request. If a directory 
      is found, the file's contents will be presented in an html based index. If a file is found, the env will be 
      passed to the specified app.
    * `Rack::ForwardRequest` - gets caught by `Rack::Recursive` and redirects the current request to the app at url
    * `Rack::Handler` - *Handlers* connect web servers with Rack. Rack includes Handlers for Thin, WEBrick, FastCGI, CGI, SCGI 
      and LiteSpeed. Handlers usually are activated by calling `MyHandler.run(myapp)`. A second optional hash can be passed 
      to include server-specific configuration.        
    * `Rack::Head` - returns an empty body for all HEAD requests. It leaves all other requests unchanged.
    * `Rack::Lint` - validates your application and the requests and responses according to the Rack spec
    * `Rack::Lock` - locks every request inside a mutex, so that every request will effectively be executed synchronously
    * `Rack::Logger` - Sets up rack.logger to write to rack.errors stream
    * `Rack::MethodOverride` - Override HTTP verbs. Lets you use HTTP verbs such as PUT or DELETE in places where the client 
       doesn't support it. The way this works is by letting the client do an HTTP POST request and set the X-HTTP-Method-Override 
       header and set the value to the intended HTTP method (such as PATCH).
    * `Rack::Mime` - Returns String with mime type if found
    * `Rack::NullLogger` -         
    * `Rack::Recursive` - allows applications called down the chain to include data from other applications (by using 
      `rack['rack.recursive.include'][...]` or raise a `ForwardRequest` to redirect internally
    * `Rack::Reloader` - High performant source reloader
    * `Rack::Runtime` - Sets an "X-Runtime" response header, indicating the response time of the request, in seconds
    * `Rack::Sendfile` - The Sendfile middleware intercepts responses whose body is being served from a file and replaces 
      it with a server specific X-Sendfile header. The web server is then responsible for writing the file contents 
      to the client
    * `Rack::Server` - Rack Server starter, used by rackup to start a rack server and use `Rack::Builder` to construct Rack 
      applications.
    * `Rack::ShowException` - for catching unhandled exceptions and presenting them in a nice and helpful way with clickable 
      backtrace.
    * `Rack::ShowStatus` catches all empty responses and replaces them
    * `Rack::Static` - intercepts requests for static files (javascript files, images, stylesheets, etc) based on the url prefixes 
      or route mappings passed in the options, and serves them using a Rack::File object. This allows a Rack stack to 
      serve both static and dynamic content. `
    * `Rack::TempfileReaper` - Middleware tracks and cleans Tempfiles created throughout a request (i.e. Rack::Multipart) 
      Ideas/strategy based on posts by Eric Wong and Charles Oliver Nutter      
    * `Rack::URLMap` - takes a hash mapping urls or paths to apps, and dispatches accordingly. Support for HTTP/1.1 host 
      names exists if the URLs start with `http://` or `https://`. URLMap modifies the `SCRIPT_NAME` and `PATH_INFO` such that 
      the part relevant for dispatch is in the `SCRIPT_NAME`, and the rest in the `PATH_INFO`. This should be taken care of 
      when you need to reconstruct the URL in order to create links.     
    * `Rack::Utils` - contains a grab-bag of useful methods for writing web applications adopted from all kinds of Ruby libraries
    * `Rack::Multipart` - A multipart form data parser, adapted from IOWA. Usually, Rack::Request#POST takes care of calling this.
    * `Rack::Request` - which also provides query string parsing and multipart handling.
    * `Rack::Response` - for convenient generation of HTTP replies and cookie handling.   
    * `Rack::MockRequest` and `Rack::MockResponse`- for efficient and quick testing of Rack application without real HTTP round-trips.
    * `Rack::Auth::Basic` - implements HTTP Basic Authentication, as per RFC 2617
    * `Rack::Auth::Digest::MD5` implements the MD5 algorithm version of HTTP Digest Authentication, as per RFC 2617.
    * `Rack::Session::Cookie` - provides simple cookie based session management. The session is a Ruby Hash stored as base64 
      encoded marshalled data set to :key (default: rack.session)
    * `Rack::Session::Pool` - provides simple cookie based session management. Session data is stored in a hash held by @pool
    * `Rack::Session::Memcache` - provides simple cookie based session management. Session data is stored in memcached                   
    * *Note that these are not middlewares*: `Rack::BodyProxy`, `Rack::Cascade`, `Rack::File`, `Rack::ForwardRequest`,

> Vagrant Middlewares
  
* [Videos: Rack Middleware as a General Purpose Abstraction by Mitchell Hashimoto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6pyhq3ZvyI)
  * the slide is available on [speakdeck](https://speakerdeck.com/mitchellh/middleware-a-general-purpose-abstraction).
  * [Generalized middleware implementation for Ruby by Mitchell Hashimoto](https://github.com/mitchellh/middleware) - ~ 130 LOC

* [Vagrant Middlewares](https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/blob/master/lib%2Fvagrant%2Faction.rb) - Vagrant calls middlewares 
  "actions" and a stack of middlewares an "action sequence." (But you may also just call them middleware and middleware stacks, 
  theyâre mostly called the other names for histortical purposes)
  
  * `Vagrant::Action::Warden` - The action warden is a middleware which injects itself between every other middleware, 
    watching for exceptions which are raised and performing proper cleanup on every action by calling the recover method. 
    The warden therefore allows middlewares to not worry about exceptional events, and by providing a simple callback, can 
    clean up in any erroneous case
  * `Vagrant::Action::Builtin::BoxAdd` - This middleware will download a remote box and add it to the given box collection.
  * `Vagrant::Action::Builtin::BoxCheckOutdated` - This middleware checks if there are outdated boxes. By default, it only 
    checks locally, but if box_outdated_refresh is set, it will refresh the metadata associated with a box.
  * `Vagrant::Action::Builtin::BoxRemove` - This middleware will remove a box for a given provider.    
  * `Vagrant::Action::Builtin::BoxUpdate` - This middleware updates a specific box if there are updates available.
  * `Vagrant::Action::Builtin::Call` - This middleware class allows a sort of "conditional" run within a single middlware 
    sequence. It takes another middleware runnable, runs it with the same environment, then yields the resulting env to a 
    block, allowing that block to determine the next course of action in the middleware sequence.
  * `Vagrant::Action::Builtin::ConfigValidate` - This class validates the configuration and raises an exception if there 
    are any validation errors.
  * `Vagrant::Action::Builtin::Confirm` - This class asks the user to confirm some sort of question with a "Y/N" question. 
    The only parameter is the text to ask the user. The result is placed in `env[:result]` so that it can be used with 
    the `Call` class.
  * `Vagrant::Action::Builtin::DestroyConfirm` - This class asks the user to confirm the destruction of a machine that Vagrant manages.
  * `Vagrant::Action::Builtin::EnvSet` - This middleware class allows you to modify the environment hash in the middle of a 
    middleware sequence. The new environmental data will take affect at this stage in the middleware and will persist through.
  * `Vagrant::Action::Builtin::GracefulHalt` - This middleware class will attempt to perform a graceful shutdown of the machine
     using the guest implementation  
  * `Vagrant::Action::Builtin::HandleBox` - This built-in middleware handles the box setting by verifying the box is already 
    installed, dowloading the box if it isn't, updating the box if it is requested, etc
  * `Vagrant::Action::Builtin::HandleBoxUrl`
  * `Vagrant::Action::Builtin::HandleForwardedPortCollisions` - This middleware class will detect and handle collisions with 
    forwarded ports, whether that means raising an error or repairing them automatically.
  * `Vagrant::Action::Builtin::IsState` - This middleware is meant to be used with Call and can check if a machine is in the 
    given state ID.
  * `Vagrant::Action::Builtin::Lock` - This class creates a multi-process lock using flock. The lock is active for the 
    remainder of the middleware stack.
  * `Vagrant::Action::Builtin::Message` - This middleware simply outputs a message to the UI.
  * `Vagrant::Action::Builtin::Provision` - This class will run the configured provisioners against the machine.
  * `Vagrant::Action::Builtin::ProvisionerCleanup` - This action will run the cleanup methods on provisioners and should 
    be used as part of any Destroy action.
  * `Vagrant::Action::Builtin::SSHExec` - This class will exec into a full fledged SSH console into the remote machine. 
    This middleware assumes that the VM is running and ready for SSH, and uses the `Machine#ssh_info` method to retrieve 
    SSH information necessary to connect.
  * `Vagrant::Action::Builtin::SSHRun` - This class will run a single command on the remote machine and will mirror the 
    output to the UI. The resulting exit status of the command will exist in the `:ssh_run_exit_status` key in the environment.
  * `Vagrant::Action::Builtin::SetHostname` - This middleware sets the hostname of the guest according to the 
    "vm.hostname" configuration parameter if it is set
  * `Vagrant::Action::Builtin::SyncedFolderCleanup` - This middleware will run cleanup tasks for synced folders using the 
    appropriate synced folder plugin
  * `Vagrant::Action::Builtin::SyncedFolders` - This middleware will setup the synced folders for the machine using the 
    appropriate synced folder plugin.
  * `Vagrant::Action::Builtin::WaitForCommunicator` - This waits for the communicator to be ready for a set amount of time.                         
            
> Vagrant Middleware Stack Builder and Runner
  
* `Vagrant::Action::Builder` - Action builder which provides a nice DSL for building up a middleware sequence for Vagrant 
  actions. This code is based heavily off of Rack::Builder and ActionDispatch::MiddlewareStack in Rack and Rails, respectively.
* `Vagrant::Action::Runner` - This runner does the default expected behavior of running the middleware stacks in order, 
  then reversing the order.
* `Vagrant::Action::Hook` - This class manages hooks into existing Builder stacks, and lets you add and remove middleware 
  classes. This is the primary method by which plugins can hook into built-in middleware stacks.   

## Inspiration

* [WSGI (Python)](http://wsgi.readthedocs.org/) - The Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) is a specification for simple 
  and universal interface between web servers and web applications or frameworks for the Python. WSGI is a Python standard

* [Rack (Ruby)](http://rack.github.io/) - Rack provides a modular and adaptable interface for developing web applications 
  in Ruby. By wrapping HTTP requests and responses it unifies the API for web servers, web frameworks, and software in between
   (the so-called middleware) into a single method call.
   
* [Plug (Elixir)](https://github.com/elixir-lang/plug) - Plug is A specification for composable modules 
  between web applications, and it's also connection adapters for different web servers in the Erlang VM.
  Plug is sinatra-like, and Elixir has a Rails-like framework called [Phoenix](http://www.phoenixframework.org/)

* [Clack (Lisp)](https://github.com/fukamachi/clack/) - Clack is a web application environment for Common Lisp inspired by 
  Python's WSGI and Ruby's Rack.   
  
* [Hack (Haskell)](https://github.com/nfjinjing/hack2) - Hack2 is a port of Ruby's Rack webserver interface.
  
* [JSGI (JavaScript)](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/JSGI) - JavaScript Gateway Interface, is an interface between web servers 
  and JavaScript-based web applications and frameworks. It was inspired by the Rack for Ruby and WSGI for Python and was one 
  of the inspirations of PSGI for Perl.  
  
* [PSGI (Perl)](https://metacpan.org/pod/PSGI) - Perl Web Server Gateway Interface is an interface between Web servers and 
  Perl-based Web applications and frameworks that allows writing portable applications that can be run as standalone servers 
  or using CGI, FastCGI, mod_perl, et al. It is inspired by the Web Server Gateway Interface for Python, Rack for Ruby and 
  JSGI for JavaScript.

* [WSAPI (Lua)](http://keplerproject.github.io/wsapi/) - WSAPI is an API that abstracts the web server from Lua web 
  applications. By coding against WSAPI your application can run on any of the supported servers and interfaces 
  (currently CGI, FastCGI and Xavante, on Windows and UNIX-based systems). WSAPI's main influence is Ruby's Rack 
  framework, but it was also influenced by Python's WSGI (`PEP 333`). It's not a direct clone of either of them, though, 
  and tries to follow standard Lua idioms. 
  
* [StackPHP (PHP)](http://stackphp.com/) - a PHP interface for framework-agnostic code sharing

* [OWIN (.NET)](http://owin.org/) - Open Web Interface for .NET, defines a standard interface between .NET web servers 
  and web applications. The goal of the OWIN interface is to decouple server and application, encourage the development
  of simple modules for .NET web development, and, by being an open standard, stimulate the open source ecosystem of 
  .NET web development tools. [Katana](https://katanaproject.codeplex.com/) is the implementation of OWIN components.
